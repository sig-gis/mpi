According to the tables in the reports, both have improved water source
categories defined by unstats.un.org, assuming bottled water == packaged
water. The 2005 report further decomposes bottled water into improved vs 
unimproved ("Because the quality of drinking water is not known, households 
using bottled water for drinking are classified as using an improved or 
non-improved source according to their water source for cooking and washing."). 
The 2005 report also has one more category under "time to obtain drinking 
water" - water delivered, in addition to water on premises, < 30 mins, >= 30 
mins, and DK.

According to the questionnaires, 
2014 sources of drinking water include the following: 
PIPED WATER 
PIPED INTO DWELLING 11 
PIPED TO YARD/PLOT 12
PUBLIC TAP/STANDPIPE 13 
TUBE WELL OR BOREHOLE 21 
DUG WELL
